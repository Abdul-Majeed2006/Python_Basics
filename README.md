# 🐍 Python Basics Learning Environment ✨

Welcome to your personal Python university. This repository is structured to take you from absolute zero to a capable Python developer ready to build games and apps.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abdul-Majeed2006/Python_Basics.git
cd Python_Basics

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

## 📂 Folder Structure

### 1. `src/` & `tests/` (Engineering Best Practices)

- **`src/`**: Contains reusable Python modules. This is where "production" code lives, separate from notebooks.
- **`tests/`**: Contains automated tests (`pytest`). This ensures our code actually works and prevents regressions.

### 2. `Notes/` (The Curriculum)

This folder contains your interactive textbooks (`.ipynb` files).
Go through them in order.

* **Foundation**
  * `L01 - L04`: Variables, Lists, Loops, Conditionals.
  * `L05 - L06`: Dictionaries, Input.
  * `L07 - L08`: Functions & Classes (The building blocks of apps).
* **The "Pro" Upgrade** (New additions!)
  * `L09 List Comprehensions`: How to write code like a senior dev.
  * `L10 Files`: Saving data.
  * `L11 Testing`: Proving your code works.
  * `L12 Standard Library`: Using built-in tools.
  * `L13 Type Hints`: Modern Python syntax.
  * `L14 Project Setup`: Virtual Environments & Pip.

## 🚀 How to Start learning

1. Install VS Code and the Python Extension.
2. Open this folder in VS Code.
3. Click on `Notes/L01 Variables...ipynb`.
4. Read the explanation, then click the **Play Button (▶)** to run the code.
5. **Complete the Mission**: Every chapter ends with a coding challenge. Do it!

Happy Coding!
