# P14: CAPSTONE (NO ESCAPE) 🎓

> **"This is where you prove you’re not pretending."**

## 🎯 The Objective
Build a complete, deployable Python application. This is not a "script". It is Software.

## 🛑 Strict Constraints
1.  **Multi-File**. `main`, `logic`, `data`, `ui`.
2.  **Error Handling**. Zero crashes allowed.
3.  **Tests**. At least 80% code coverage.
4.  **Documentation**. A `README.md` that explains how to install and run it.

## 🔨 Choose Your Path
### Path A: Robotics Control Script
- A control loop that reads "sensor" data (simulated), applies PID logic, and commands "actuators".
- Must handle latency simulation and sensor noise.

### Path B: Backend API
- A FastAPI app for a "Task Manager".
- Endpoints: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- Persistence: SQLite database.

### Path C: Automation Suite
- A tool that organizes a messy "Downloads" folder into categories (Images, Docs, Installers) and logs every move.
- Must handle name collisions.

## 💡 Final Word
If you finish this, you are no longer a beginner. You are an Engineer.
